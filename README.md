<h3> Objective
Students will employ good software design and testing principles in order to create a console application using Object Oriented principles (Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance and Encapsulation).

University Clinic Hospital is an organizational mess. They have unkempt files of employee information scattered throughout manilla folders, computer data files, and old tin filing cabinets. With the madness of the daily grind, patients are the priority. But the utmost care cannot be given to the patients if the hospital is disorganized. University Clinic Hospital wants to get it together. They have subcontracted We Can Code IT full-stack apprentices (who work for the reasonably inexpensive price of free) to come in and organize. They enable you to set up shop with a few company laptops in an old disheveled break room. Your mission is to create a set of classes that contain information on the employees at University Clinic Hospital.
